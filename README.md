# Water Safety Predictor App

A **machine learning-powered web app** to predict water safety based on **salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, water depth, and temperature** for environmental monitoring, research, and community awareness.


## Overview

The **Water Safety Predictor App** allows users to:
Enter key water quality parameters
Instantly predict if water conditions are safe

This app helps environmental researchers, policymakers, and community health workers **make informed decisions about water safety.**

## App Interface

**Parameters: Salinity, Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Water Depth, Temperature:** Enter measured values.
Click **Predict** to receive an instant water safety assessment.

##  How It Works

* Uses a **trained machine learning model** to classify water safety conditions.
* Built with:
  * Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
  * Gradio/Streamlit (for interactive interface)
  * Deployed for **easy mobile and desktop access**.

## Features

Predicts water safety instantly based on environmental parameters.
User-friendly interface accessible on mobile and desktop.
Can be expanded to include additional water quality metrics and advanced models.

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **pandas, scikit-learn**
* **Gradio** (for app deployment)
* **GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)
